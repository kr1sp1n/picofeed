HELP WANTED!

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or sub par.
My research is generating code at a higher rate than documentation and
I'm personally drowning in small administrational todos.
Thus you have my sincere apologies.

If you have any questions, [PLEASE OPEN AN ISSUE](./issues) -
it will hopefully save time for both of us.

I publish all of my work as Libre software and will continue to do so,
please drop me a penny at [Patreon]() and fund this project.
