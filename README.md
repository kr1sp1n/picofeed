> Microscopic Secure Feed occupying a single buffer

This is a tiny secure blockchain, it's designed to live within an URL.

Looks like major desktop & mobile browsers have support
for at least 64kilobyte of data after the `#`-component.

Why? URLs are everywhere!

- URLs can be stored on most platforms and channels
- Sharing urls is easy
- [No network code](https://xkcd.com/2259/)
- Browser support via Browserify / node-globals (requires Buffer shim)

now picofeeds can be everywhere too.

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

```
const Pico = require('picofeed')

const feed = new Pico()
console.log(feed.key) // => 32byte, Buffer
console.log(feed.secretKey) // => 32byte, Buffer

feed.append('Hello') // => 1
feed.get(0) // => 'Hello'

const url = 'http://myapp.tld/#' + feed.pickle()

// share the url

const remoteFeed = new Pico(url)
remoteFeed.get(0) // => 'Hello'

const { publicKey, secretKey } = // generate a sodium sign_pair

// Attach a block to feed
remoteFeed.append('Hey bob!', secretKey)

// second URL containing 2 blocks from 2 different identities.
const url2 = 'http://myapp.tld/#' + remoteFeed.pickle()
